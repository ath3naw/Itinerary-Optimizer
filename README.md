# Itinerary-Optimizer
This is a repository for optimizing itineraries for travel destinations based on user preferences, weather, and transportation constraints

Notes:
Add optimization for:
1. rainy days
2. indoor activities vs outdoor activities
3. diversified activities
4. free vs non-free activities
5. spaced out activities (not two in the same place)
6. popularity/recommended
7. different sections (e.g. public transport to another area, grouping areas to explore for different days) - use k-means++ for grouping
